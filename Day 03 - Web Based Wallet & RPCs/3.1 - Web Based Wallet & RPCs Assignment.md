# 3.1 - Web Based Wallet & RPCs — Assignment

> **Reference**: https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/web-wallet-rpc/Creating-a-web-based-wallet--RPCs-1

---

## 🎯 Assignment Goals

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to build a working web-based crypto wallet that:
- Generates a mnemonic seed phrase
- Derives multiple Solana and Ethereum wallets from a single seed
- Queries the blockchain via RPC to fetch wallet balances
- Displays all wallet addresses with their balances

---

## ✅ Tasks

### Task 1 — Project Setup

1. Initialize an empty Vite React project
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest web-wallet
   cd web-wallet
   npm install
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install bip39 @solana/web3.js tweetnacl ed25519-hd-key ethers
   npm install vite-plugin-node-polyfills
   ```

3. Configure `vite.config.js` to include node polyfills so crypto libraries work in the browser.

---

### Task 2 — Mnemonic Generation

1. Create a state variable to hold the mnemonic.
2. Add a button that generates a random 12-word mnemonic using `bip39`.
3. Display the mnemonic in an input box.

**Expected Output**: Clicking the button should show 12 words like:
```
soccer drum orbit habit corn fetch ribbon melody fox brown wine cup
```

---

### Task 3 — Solana Wallet Generator

Build a `SolanaWallet` component that:
1. Accepts `mnemonic` as a prop
2. Has an "Add Wallet" button that:
   - Converts the mnemonic to a seed
   - Derives a new keypair using path `m/44'/501'/${index}'/0'`
   - Increments the index for the next wallet
3. Displays all derived public keys

**Hint**: Use `mnemonicToSeed` from bip39, `derivePath` from `ed25519-hd-key`, and `Keypair` from `@solana/web3.js`.

---

### Task 4 — Ethereum Wallet Generator

Build an `ETHWallet` component that:
1. Accepts `mnemonic` as a prop
2. Has an "Add ETH Wallet" button that:
   - Converts mnemonic to seed
   - Derives using path `m/44'/60'/${index}'/0'`
   - Creates an `ethers.Wallet` from the private key
3. Displays all derived Ethereum addresses

---

### Task 5 — Fetch Balances via RPC (Stretch Goal ⭐)

1. Get a free RPC URL from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) (use Sepolia testnet for ETH)
2. Store your API key in a `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_ALCHEMY_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
   ```
3. For each ETH wallet address, call `eth_getBalance` via JSON-RPC or using ethers.js:
   ```js
   const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(import.meta.env.VITE_ALCHEMY_RPC_URL);
   const balance = await provider.getBalance(address);
   ```
4. Display the balance in ETH next to each address.

---

### Task 6 — Send Transaction (Advanced ⭐⭐)

Add a "Send" button on each wallet that:
1. Opens a form asking for recipient address and amount
2. Signs and sends the transaction using ethers.js
3. Shows the transaction hash on success

---

## 📦 Submission

- Push your code to GitHub
- Add the live deployed link (Vercel recommended)
- Your README should include setup instructions and screenshots
